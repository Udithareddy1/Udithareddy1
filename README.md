## 🚀 About Me  

-I am Uditha Reddy, a passionate learner and a Master’s student in Data Science. My core interests lie in Business Analytics, Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. I enjoy solving problems with Python, Java, SQL, and Neo4j by blending analytical skills with creativity. I have hands-on experience in Machine Learning, NLP, and Data Visualization tools like Power BI and Excel.I believe that data-driven insights can create impactful real-world solutions across industries. Apart from technical skills, I love working on creative projects that combine design and technology. I am curious, adaptable, and always eager to learn new tools, frameworks, and technologies. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are values I truly believe in, which is why I contribute to projects on GitHub. My ultimate goal is to grow as a Data Scientist/Analyst and use technology to make a positive impact.
